"# Binary Trees
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**.
It aims to learn about **binary trees** and how to implement different operations such as node creation, insertion, deletion, traversals, measuring height, depth, size, and finding relatives like parents, siblings, and uncles in **C**.

## Technologies

* `C` (compiled with `gcc` using `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`)
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

All the following files are scripts in C:
